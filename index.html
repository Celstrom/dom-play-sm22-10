            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">Where would you be without me? Gollum! Gollum! I saved us! It was me! We survived because of me! (Smeagol stopped crying)</span></p>

            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">What did you say?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">Master looks after us now. We don't need you.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">What?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">Leave now, and never come back!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">No!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol"> LEAVE NOW AND NEVER COME BACK! (Gollum growled back in frustration) LEAVE NOW AND NEVER COME BACK! (Silence)
                (Smeagol hesitated and looked around, then realized that Gollum had left, and he began to dance and jump around)
                We told him to go away. And away he goes, precious! Gone! Gone! Gone! Smeagol is free!</span></p>
