            <h2>This page is another example of how JavaScript can be useful on webpages. By adding an event listener on click of certain aspects of the page (in this case when you click on one of the lines of script) certain lines will be highlighted, making it easier to know which lines are yours to read. This is done by adding a function with if and else statements, if the highlight is yellow, then turn it to white and if the highlight it white, turn it to yellow.  By adding an alert, when you click on a line, the character who is speaking that line will pop up as an alert, in this case, when you click on a line it will either trigger a popup saying "Gollum", or "Smeagol".

            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">(with an evil expression) We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little Hobbitses. Wicked. Tricksy. False!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">(sweetly) No. Not master.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, LIE.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">Master's my friend!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">(covering his ears) Not listening, I'm not listening.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">You're a liar and a thief.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">No.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">Mur-der-er.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">Go away!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">Go away? (Gollum laughed manically as Smeagol began crying)</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol"> I hate you, I hate you.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">Where would you be without me? Gollum! Gollum! I saved us! It was me! We survived because of me! (Smeagol stopped crying)</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">Not anymore.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">What did you say?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">Master looks after us now. We don't need you.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">What?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol">Leave now, and never come back!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Gollum">No!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="Smeagol"> LEAVE NOW AND NEVER COME BACK! (Gollum growled back in frustration) LEAVE NOW AND NEVER COME BACK! (Silence)
                (Smeagol hesitated and looked around, then realized that Gollum had left, and he began to dance and jump around)
                We told him to go away. And away he goes, precious! Gone! Gone! Gone! Smeagol is free!</span></p>
